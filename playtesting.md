# Playtesting – GROUP Wednesday, April 29th 
By playtest time, your game should be playable by users outside of the development team. This means
near-final versions of all art assets, and decently balanced, suitable for players of various skill levels.
During playtesting, your intent should be getting feedback on your game with the short (and possibly
long) term intent to make your game more playable and/or more fun. At this point, you should add no
more new features to your game nor make and major game or code changes.

Since physical playtesting sessions are not be scheduled this term, you will have to provide a downloadable version of your game to the greater IMGD student body. Keep in mind that not everyone will be able to play your game. So you should determine system spec requirements when sending out your playtesting emails to IMGD students.

In addition to the above, you should include a survey/form in your email in which you ask your playtesters about your game. You are in charge of the questions being asked, but ask yourselves what is of value for you to know at this stage. Are the gameplay objectives clear? Is the game fun to play? Etc.

When submitting your Beta materials, each team will provide a report on the playtesting. This report in PDF (only!) must include:   
• The specific goals of their playtesting   
• The original survey form and the playtesters' responses   
• Developer notes from the playtest session   
• Summary of main take-aways from playtesters   
• Changes made to the game (if any) based on the playtesting

# Treatment Document  
Turn this in as a GROUP  
Due April 5th by midnight  

Review the [design constraints](./finalProjectConstraints.md) before working on this treatment! Submit a PDF file (this is the only format that is acceptable) by due the date
through Slack.

Note, the treatment is not a contract, but rather a chance for the team to think through most aspects of
the game before starting. You may, and likely will, change your mind about details as you work on the
project––that is fine.

Keep a copy of this document and add it to your game website, as soon as it is created (see the timeline
for when the website needs to be up).
The elevator pitch below should be a maximum of three sentences, e.g., "A top-down shooter using rotten vegetables that takes place in the supermarket produce section. You win the game by hitting your
opponent with a complete salad."

- Game Title
- Team Leader (include email)
- IMGD 4000 Students (including emails)

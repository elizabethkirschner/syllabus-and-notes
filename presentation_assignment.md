# IMGD 4000 Presentation assignment
Take one interesting technical aspect of your development work for your team project and present it to the class in a fifteen minute presentation. This is an **optional assignment** that can take the place of either the Boids or Pathfinding assignment (but not both).

Please let me know if you would like to use this option by **Wednesday, April 29th.**

1. Create a sample project that illustrates the basic concept **in as simple a project as is possible**. Try to minimize the number of assets, C++ file, blueprints used etc. so that the project can be quickly understood. Upload the file to GitHub so everyone can access it.
2. Do a fifteen-minute presentation in class. I strongly consider the following format:
	• 1–2 minute overview    
	• 8–9 minute presentation of your example project
	• 3 minute overview of how the technical concept is used in your group project
	• 2 minute Q&A

## Grading
50% : Example project is uploaded correctly and properly constrained to the presentation project.
50% : Presentation is reasonably well-practiced… you’re not just making everything up on the spot.

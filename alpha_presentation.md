# Alpha Presentation and Release â€“ Wednesday, April 22nd 
The Alpha presentations will be held via Zoom. Every team will give a short (~8 minute) presentation, which includes a demonstration that starts by visiting their website and clicking on the download link to your executable to show that your game is downloadable and playable. Make sure you test this ahead of time!

Presentation slides for your Alpha presentation should focus on the current state of your game, and should include tech and art processes. Note that both Tech and Art students are required to present
on their technical and creative methods during this presentation! Everyone in your team should be speaking at some point.

At the Alpha stage, your game should have all of the required features implemented, but not necessarily
working completely correctly. Your game code should be tested thoroughly enough to eliminate any
critical gameplay flaws, but minor bugs or glitches may be present. Your game should compile cleanly and be runnable, and separate features of the game demonstrable. Your game is most likely not yet finally balanced.

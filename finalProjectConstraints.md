# Game Design Constraints
Note: for purposes of this document, the term "game" applies to any type of interactive experience you choose to make for your final project.  

The following are required constraints on your game design and implementation. The reasons
for these constraints are pedagogical, but almost all game projects have some significant constraints,
whether they come from technical, financial, legal or market (or pedagogical) sources. Note that when
constraints below say "at least", that means you may exceed the requirement, but we strongly
recommend against it, since it is better to do a more polished job with limited scope than to only partially accomplish overly ambitious goals.

Notice that the setting, narrative, character personality and game mechanic aspects of your project are
not constrained. 

The game design must include:
- A solid gameplay mechanic which makes your game enjoyable and fun to play set in a 3D environment using 3D assets. Note, this does not mean that the camera cannot be locked to a single angle. 2D gameplay mechanics are thus allowed, but should use 3D assets.
- 1 fully-animated biped or quadruped main character. This character can be used as either a player avatar (third person game) or a featured non-player character (NPC).
- At least 4 secondary animated non-player characters or interactive objects that the main character interacts with.
- A single environment/level with at least 20 static level objects (buildings, foliage, etc.).
- At least 25 unique triggerable sound effects.

The following are additional art-specific requirements for each IMGD 4500 student, which are included
here for the shared knowledge of the entire team:
- The main character shall be modeled, optimized, textured (diffuse, metalness and glossiness, normal map), rigged, and animated with at least the following animations: walk, run, idle, jump, and two additional game-specific actions.
- The secondary characters and interactive objects shall be modeled, optimized, textured (diffuse, metalness and glossiness, normal map), rigged and animated with at least 2 unique animations.
- The game environment, with texture and lighting, shall contain at least 20 static objects, all of which must have full texture sets (diffuse, metalness and glossiness, normal map).
- At least 25 unique sound effects (all triggerable/interactive).
- 1 ambient stage sound track.
- At least 5 particle effects (associated with specific gameplay actions or ambient)
      
No stock art assets are to be used in this project without notifying the Professors. This also applies to
sounds. Stock assets will be considered and have to be approved before they may be downloaded from
websites with proper licensing.
